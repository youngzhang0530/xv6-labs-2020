Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: The ax registers is resposible for containing arguments. The a2 holds 13.

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? 
   (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: The functions are inlined, so there are no calls to them.

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x630.

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38.

Q: Run the following code.
	 unsigned int i = 0x646c7200;
	 printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
   What is the output? The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
   If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
   Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: The output is HE110 World.
   The i should be set as 0x726c6400.
   It doesn't need.

Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) 
   Why does this happen?
	 printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A: 5221 will be printed. 
   Because 5221 will be load from a2 whose value is not sure.
